# FaceAssist
Senior design - Android 

Face Assistant is an Android and Google Glass application developed for CCNY's Senior Design course. 
The application uses facial recognition to assist those who are suffering from prosopagnosia, 
also known as face blindness, identify their loved ones. The application works as follows:

- The user uploads images of the loved one they want our application to recognize
- Once our system finishes training itself with the provided images, the user can in the future take 
  a photo of the loved one and we will return to the user the loved one's name and relationship to the user
- The user also has the ability to use our application to recognize some pre-trained celebrities
